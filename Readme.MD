</h2>
<p>1. define a function</p>
<p>2. inside the function create a while loop with the boolean statement true</p>
<p>3. Create a variable and store and put in an input statement to get the username from the user </p>
<p>4. Create another variable and store and put in an input statement to get the password created from the user </p>
<p>5. Create a variable and store and put in an input statement to get the confirmation of password from the user </p>
<p>6. Under the while loop create an if conditional statement to verify if the password created is the same with the confirmed password inserted by the user   </p>
<p>7. inside the if conditional statement insert a print function then insert a break function </p>
<p>8. create an else statement if the confirmed password is not aligning with teh password created</p>
<p>9. inside the else statement create a print statement to print the statement for password verification failed</p>
<p>10. then leave the if and while statement and call the name of the function for verified password so has to make it a recursion </p>
<p>11.define a function for user login </p>
<p>12.create a while loop with the statement while true</p>
<P>13.create a variable and store password gotten from the user</P>
<P>14.create a variable and store confirmation password gotten from the user</P>
<P>15.create an if conditional statement Check if the user inputted password matches the verify password and the user info verify password</P>
<P>16.If there is a match, print "Password verified successfully!" including the username and password. Then, break the loop</P>
<P>17.If there is no match, print "Password verification failed. Retry"</P>
<P>18.End the password verification algorithm</P>
<P>19.Begin the algorithm for user info verification</P>
<P>20.Implement the steps to verify user information such as username, email and security questions</P>
<P>21.Return a success message if all details are confirmed</P>
<P>22.If any detail is incorrect, prompt the user to retry or recover their account</P>
<P>23.End the user info verification algorithm</P>
