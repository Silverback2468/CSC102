</h2>
<p>1. define a function</p>
<p>2. inside the function create a while loop with the boolean statement true</p>
<p>3. Create a variable and store and put in an input statement to get the username from the user </p>
<p>4. Create another variable and store and put in an input statement to get the password created from the user </p>
<p>5. Create a variable and store and put in an input statement to get the confirmation of password from the user </p>
<p>6. Under the while loop create an if conditional statement to verify if the password created is the same with the confirmed password inserted by the user   </p>
<p>7. inside the if conditional statement insert a print function then insert a break function </p>
<p>8. create an else statement if the confirmed password is not aligning with teh password created</p>
<p>9. inside the else statement create a print statement to print the statement for password verification failed</p>
<p>10. then leave the if and while statement and call the name of the function for verified password so has to make it a recursion </p>
